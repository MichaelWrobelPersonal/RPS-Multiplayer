# About the Theme

For this game of Rock Paper Scissors, I wanted to tie it into a broader theme of the game's use as a means of settling disputes.  What better theme to base it on other than the Cold War era famous Spy-vs-Spy comic.  The subtile suggestion of the game is that if more world leaders (and everyday folks as well) today played a simple game, we would all be much the better for it.
